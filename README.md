For those of you that are broken like me! 

This is a resourcepack for Minecraft (tested on 1.21.5) that rotates and translates the held items (just tools for now) in the players hand in first person to be how it used to in beta builds of the game. I got it as close to pixel perfect as I can sanely get.
